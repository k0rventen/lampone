# this is kinda weird, but allowing the VIP for self access (mainly for OIDC callbacks)
# do not work, but setting the pod subnet as cidr works, while using 443 (although it's not the final port)
# this does not allow local svc comm (xx.ns.svc.cluster.local) as the subnet is different
# so the deny-all still works
